# Instacart Customer Retention Project

This is a project by Nicki (Nicola) Kornbluth, Daniel Moskowitz, Sanchya Sahay, and Metika Sikka done for Business Analytics, Spring 2020 at Columbia University.

Our primary goal was to use machine learning models to make customer retention marketing recommendations to Instacart based on “The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017”, Accessed from https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017 in February 2020. 

We took a two-pronged approach:
1. Reducing time between orders (and therefore, increasing order frequency)
2. Increasing reorder rates (to entrench Instacart in customers' grocery shopping habits)

The analysis was performed on R studio server. The codes for these two models, as well as the slides we presented to our class, are in this repo.
